This is an **HTML form** for student registration. Let me break it down step by step:

### **1. Basic HTML Structure**
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type.
- The `<html>` tag contains the entire webpage.
- The `<head>` section is where the title and metadata would go (though the `<title>` is empty in this case).
- The `<body>` contains the content of the page.

---

### **2. Heading and Form Start**
- `<h1>REGISTER FORM</h1>` displays a large heading.
- The `<form>` tag begins the registration form.

---

### **3. Student Details Section**
- `<h2>Student detail</h2>` adds a subsection heading.
- Various `<label>` and `<input>` fields collect:
  - **First name** (Required)
  - **Last name** (Required)
  - **Registration number** (Required)

---

### **4. Year & Semester Selection**
- Two `<select>` dropdowns allow users to choose:
  - Their **year** (1st to 4th)
  - Their **semester** (1st to 4th)

---

### **5. Gender Selection**
- Three `<input type="radio">` buttons let users choose between:
  - Male
  - Female
  - Other

*Note:* All radio buttons share the same `name="gender"` so only one can be selected.

---

### **6. Department Selection**
- A `<select>` dropdown lets students choose their **department** from options like IT, CSE, EEE, etc.

*Issue:*  
The `<select>` tag is incorrectly repeated before **DEGREE**. The extra `<select>` tag should be removed.

---

### **7. Degree Selection**
- Another `<select>` dropdown lets students choose their **degree** (BTech, BE, or Others).

---

### **8. Phone Number Input**
- `<input type="tel">` is used for phone numbers.
- The `pattern="[0-9]{5}-[0-9]{5}"` ensures the format is `12345-67890`.

---

### **9. Address and Email**
- A text input collects the **address**.
- Another text input collects the **email**.

---

### **10. Submit Button**
- `<input type="Submit">` submits the form.

---

### **Issues in the Code**
1. **Incorrect Closing of Select Tag:**  
   - The `<select>` tag after the **DEPARTMENT** dropdown is mistakenly opened again before **DEGREE**.
   - It should be removed or properly closed.

2. **Email Input Type:**  
   - Instead of `<input type="text" name="E-mail">`, it should be:
     ```html
     <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="E-mail">
     ```
     This ensures valid email format.

3. **Phone Number Validation Issue:**  
   - The pattern `[0-9]{5}-[0-9]{5}` requires a hyphen.
   - A better pattern: `[0-9]{10}` (10 digits without hyphens).

### **Final Thoughts**
This form is a good start but needs minor corrections for proper functionality. Also, adding **CSS styles** and **JavaScript validation**
